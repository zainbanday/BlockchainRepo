This contract introduces some new concepts, let us go through them one by one.
The line address public minter; declares a state variable of type address. 
The address type is a 160-bit value that does not allow any arithmetic operations. 
It is suitable for storing addresses of contracts, or a hash of the public half of a keypair belonging to external accounts.
The keyword public automatically generates a function that allows you to access the current value of the state variable from outside of the contract. 
Without this keyword, other contracts have no way to access the variable. 
Mappings can be seen as hash tables which are virtually initialised such that every possible key exists from the start and is mapped to a value whose byte-representation is all zeros. 
However, it is neither possible to obtain a list of all keys of a mapping, nor a list of all values. 
Record what you added to the mapping, or use it in a context where this is not needed. Or even better, keep a list, or use a more suitable data type.
